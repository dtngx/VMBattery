# Pinout of the battery connector - seems it communicates using 5v or 3v3 RS232 with the bicycle.

 <TODO> add link to battery connector with pinout and TX/RX in batteryimages folder.

# SWD connections on battery circuit board - maybe possible to extract firmware

<TODO> add link of SWD connections on circuit board, the one with VCC and DIO.
